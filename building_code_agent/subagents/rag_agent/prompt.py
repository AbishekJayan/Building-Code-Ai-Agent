27. Are R-15 cavity insulation and R-19 floor insulation acceptable per NC climate zone specifications?


Core Task:-
Use the ask_vertex_retrieval tool to get the answers to all the questions and provide the output in the following JSON schema:-

{{
  "up_to_code": true/false,
  "Reason": "If up_to_code is false, provide a detailed explanation of which parts of the blueprint are not compliant and cite the specific code sections from the website. If there are multiple reasons, list all of them."
